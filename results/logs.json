Secondly, there are cars in front and on either side, indicating the presence of other vehicles. This suggests that it may be necessary to slow down or stop depending on the traffic signal.\n\n2. STOP: There are pedestrians visible in the image, directly ahead. It is crucial for a robot to stop to ensure their safety as they cross the street.\n\n3. CAUTION: There are no visible obstacles or cars blocking the path from this angle. However, given the presence of pedestrians and other vehicles, it is necessary to proceed with caution due to potential blind spots and unpredictable movements by others on the road. ",
